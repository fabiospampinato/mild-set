# MildSet

A WeakSet that supports any value, it holds strong references to primitives, and weak references to objects.

## Install

```sh
npm install mild-set
```

## Usage

It has the same API of a WeakSet, except that it just works with primitives too.

It also implements the `size` property, like a Set.
